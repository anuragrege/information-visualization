# Graph Analysis using GEPHI
This repository contains an analysis of the Yeast Protein-Protein Interaction Network. The analysis aims to explore the structural properties of the network, focusing on key metrics such as average degree, graph density, modularity, and the number of communities. These metrics provide insights into the organization and functional clustering of proteins within the yeast proteome, revealing the network's modular structure and its implications for cellular functions.
